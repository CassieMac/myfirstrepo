Dave is helping me create my own Rosetta Stone.  Thanks!

I’m lost for the moment.  Dave will help find me  :-)

So, now I wanna see the GUI view of this stuff.

I’m lost.  What a surprise!

So, now Sara is helping me.  YAY!
So, without GUI, I’m gonna type gitk  - HA

Let’s try a SAVE one more time.

OKAY, NOW WE’RE WORKING ON THE BRANCH OR THE CLONE OF THE MASTER.
